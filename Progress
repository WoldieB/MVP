1. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the progress made this week as an 8.
2. This week, significant progress was made in implementing the core functionality of the e-commerce system for the food restaurant and market store. The code for adding products to the cart, calculating the total price, and displaying the available products to the customer has been successfully developed. Additionally, error handling for invalid inputs has been implemented to enhance the user experience.
3. The parts of the project that are completed as planned include setting up the Product and ShoppingCart classes, creating sample products, displaying available products to the customer, and calculating the total price of the order.
4. The aspects of the project that are incomplete include integrating payment processing functionality, implementing order confirmation and tracking features, and enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive shopping experience. These aspects will be addressed in the upcoming development phases to further enhance the e-commerce system.
